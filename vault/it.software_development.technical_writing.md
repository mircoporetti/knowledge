# *** Part 1 ***

## Abbreviations

Yesterday I created a Pull Request (PR). The PR covered X use cases

## Pronouns

Python is interpreted. It has an almost cult-like following.

Don't use pronouns if too much distant from its noun or if there is ambiguity like:

- Python is interpreted, while C++ is compiled. It has an almost cult-like following.
- Running the process configures permissions and generates a user ID. This lets users authenticate to the app.

To help readers, avoid using this or that in ways where it's not clear what they refer to. Use either of the following tactics to clarify ambiguous uses of this and that:

Replace this or that with the appropriate noun.
Place a noun immediately after this or that.

## Active voice vs Passive voice

The vast majority of sentences in technical writing should be in active voice. Most readers mentally convert passive voice to active voice. Passive voice obfuscates your ideas. Active voice is generally shorter than passive voice.

Active Voice Sentence = actor + verb + target

Passive Voice Sentence = target + verb + actor

Imperative verbs are typically active

## Clear Sentence

### Verbs

To engage and educate readers, choose precise, strong, specific verbs. Reduce imprecise, weak, or generic verbs, such as the following:

- Forms of be: is, are, am, was, were, etc.
- Occur
- Happen

### There is/ There are

In the best-case scenario, you may simply delete There is or There are:

- There is a variable called met_trick that stores the current accuracy -> A variable named met_trick stores the current accuracy.
- There are two disturbing facts about Perl you should know. -> You should know two disturbing facts about Perl.

## Short Sentence

Sentences should be minimized.

- Focus each sentence on a single idea, thought, or concept.
- SOmetimes you can break sentences to lists
- Reduce extraneous words: An input value greater than 100 causes the triggering of logging. -> An input value greater than 100 triggers logging.

## List and tables

- Choose the right type of list (ordered or unordered)
- Prefer bulleted or numbered lists over embedded lists 
- Prefer parallel lists (lists of points related each others and all in active voice)

## Paragraphs

- Use good opening sentence
- Paragraph should focus on single topic
- Paragraph shouldn't be too long or too short

## Audience

Make sure your document provides the information that your audience needs but doesn't already have:

- Define your audience.
- Determine what your audience needs to learn.
- Fit documentation to your audience.

Experts often suffer from the curse of knowledge, which means that their expert understanding of a topic ruins their explanations to newcomers.

Prefer simple words.

## Documents

- Define document scope: This document describes the design of Project Frambus.
- A good document explicitly specifies its audience or prerequisite knowledge.
- Compare and contrast your ideas with concepts that your audience already understands.

### Define your Audience's needs and organize the document based on them:

- Who is your target audience? 
- What is your target audience's goal?
- What do your readers already know before they read your document?
- What should your readers know or be able to do after they read your document?
